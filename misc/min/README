Slightly modified version of Ken Tindell's Microcontroller Interconnect Network (MIN) version 1.0

- use the whole control byte to be able to manage payload up to 160 bytes : max packet size = (1 + 1 + 160 + 2) + (1 + 1 + 160 + 2) / 2 = 246
- maybe a bugfix in fletcher16 tx generation functions
- manage tx buffer directly and introduce min_frame_send callback
