ifusb is a simple toolkit to access GPIO/UART/SPI/I2C from USB host through microcontroller.
It was initialy attended for use with eink controller project, but can be used as a tool for any project, like a Bus Pirate board or a FT2232 chip.

Firmware use libopencm3 and has been tested with STM32F042 microcontroller.
PR 663 is needed for I2C on STM32F0 https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3/pull/663
$ git fetch origin pull/663/head:pr-663
$ git checkout pr-663

Do not forget to edit OPENCM3_DIR in firmware/Makefine to your libopencm3 path.

Host library use libusb 1.0.

Finally, a reference design is available in hardware/ directory.

ifusb user access udev rules:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="f055", ATTR{idProduct}=="cafe", MODE="0666"

- UART RX + MIN
